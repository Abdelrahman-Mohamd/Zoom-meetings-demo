# Testing Guide - Live Meetings App Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Participant Count Showing 0

**Problem**: Participants weren't being tracked properly on the client side.
**Solution**:

- Improved Socket.IO event handling in `VideoCallFixed.tsx`
- Added proper participant state management
- Enhanced server-side logging and participant tracking in `server.js`

### 2. Camera Not Working

**Problem**: WebRTC peer connections weren't being established correctly.
**Solution**:

- Rewrote the WebRTC connection logic in `VideoCallFixed.tsx`
- Fixed the offer/answer exchange process
- Improved media stream handling and error recovery
- Added proper cleanup of peer connections

### 3. Duplicate Interface Definitions

**Problem**: TypeScript interfaces were defined multiple times.
**Solution**: Cleaned up duplicate interface definitions in `MeetingRoom.tsx`

## Key Improvements Made

### Frontend (VideoCallFixed.tsx)

- ✅ Better media stream initialization with fallback options
- ✅ Improved Socket.IO connection handling with WebSocket transport
- ✅ Enhanced WebRTC peer connection management
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- ✅ Proper cleanup of resources on component unmount
- ✅ Debug information panel showing connection status

### Backend (server.js)

- ✅ Enhanced participant tracking with better logging
- ✅ Improved Socket.IO event forwarding for WebRTC signaling
- ✅ Better disconnect handling with participant cleanup
- ✅ Direct peer-to-peer signaling (offer/answer sent directly to target)

## Testing Steps

### 1. Single Device Test

1. Open `http://192.168.1.3:5174` in your browser
2. Click "Host Meeting" and enter your name
3. Create a meeting - you should see:
   - Your own video feed
   - Participant count: 1
   - Debug info showing: Local Stream ✓, Socket Connected ✓

### 2. Multi-Device Test

1. **Device 1** (Host):

   - Open `http://192.168.1.3:5174`
   - Click "Host Meeting", enter name, create meeting
   - Copy the meeting ID

2. **Device 2** (Guest):

   - Open `http://192.168.1.3:5174`
   - Click "Join Meeting", enter name and meeting ID
   - Click "Join Meeting"

3. **Expected Results**:
   - Both devices should show participant count: 2
   - Both devices should see their own video + remote video
   - Console logs should show successful WebRTC connection establishment

## Debug Information

The app now includes a debug panel at the bottom showing:

- Local Stream status
- Socket connection status
- Number of peer connections
- Number of remote streams

## Console Debugging

Open browser console (F12) to see detailed logs:

- Media access requests
- Socket connection events
- WebRTC offer/answer exchanges
- ICE candidate exchanges
- Participant join/leave events

## Network Configuration

- **Frontend**: http://192.168.1.3:5174
- **Backend**: http://192.168.1.3:3001
- **CORS**: Configured to allow the frontend origin
- **Binding**: Both servers bind to 0.0.0.0 for network access

## Troubleshooting

### If Camera Still Doesn't Work:

1. Check browser permissions for camera/microphone
2. Try in different browsers (Chrome/Edge recommended)
3. Check console for WebRTC errors
4. Ensure both devices are on the same network

### If Participants Don't Show:

1. Check browser console for Socket.IO connection errors
2. Verify network connectivity between devices
3. Check if firewalls are blocking the ports
4. Look at the debug info panel for connection status

### If Video Doesn't Appear:

1. Check if WebRTC peer connections are established (console logs)
2. Verify STUN servers are accessible
3. Try refreshing both pages
4. Check for any ICE candidate exchange errors

## Current Status

✅ Backend server running on port 3001
✅ Frontend server running on port 5174  
✅ Fixed WebRTC connection issues
✅ Fixed participant tracking
✅ Added comprehensive debugging
✅ Ready for multi-device testing
