# URGENT: Camera Access Issue Resolution

## Problem Identified âœ…

The error `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getUserMedia')` occurs because:

**ðŸ”’ Browser Security Restriction**: Modern browsers only allow camera/microphone access on:

- `https://` (secure connections)
- `localhost` (local development)
- NOT on IP addresses like `192.168.1.3` (considered insecure)

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Use Localhost (Recommended for Testing)

```
Instead of: http://192.168.1.3:5174
Use: http://localhost:5174
```

**BUT**: This only works for single-device testing, not multi-device.

### Option 2: Test Multi-Device WITHOUT Camera First

Let me create a version that works without camera to test the participant joining functionality.

### Option 3: Enable HTTPS (For Production)

We can set up HTTPS certificates, but that's overkill for local testing.

## Quick Fix for Testing

Let me modify the component to:

1. âœ… Test participant joining without camera
2. âœ… Show when camera is blocked vs. working
3. âœ… Allow you to verify the core functionality

The participant joining should work regardless of camera access.

## Current Status

- ðŸŸ¢ **Server**: Working perfectly
- ðŸŸ¢ **Socket.IO**: Connecting properly
- ðŸ”´ **Camera**: Blocked due to non-secure context
- ðŸŸ¡ **Solution**: Test with localhost first, then fix camera issue

Would you like me to:

1. Create a no-camera version to test participant joining?
2. Set up HTTPS for proper camera access?
3. Or try a different approach?
