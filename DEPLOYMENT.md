# ðŸš€ Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the Live Meetings App so you can test it with friends online.

## Option 1: Quick Deploy (Recommended)

### Deploy Backend to Railway

1. **Sign up for Railway** (Free tier available)

   - Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Sign up with GitHub

2. **Deploy Backend**

   - Click "Start a New Project"
   - Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your repository
   - Choose the `server` folder as the root directory
   - Railway will automatically detect it's a Node.js app

3. **Set Environment Variables in Railway**
   - Go to your project settings
   - Add these environment variables:
     ```
     JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
     CLIENT_URL=https://your-frontend-url.vercel.app
     ```
   - Railway will provide your backend URL (something like: `https://your-app.railway.app`)

### Deploy Frontend to Vercel

1. **Sign up for Vercel** (Free tier available)

   - Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Sign up with GitHub

2. **Deploy Frontend**

   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect it's a Vite React app
   - Before deploying, add environment variable:
     ```
     VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app
     ```
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Update Backend CORS**
   - Once your frontend is deployed, copy the Vercel URL
   - Go back to Railway and update the `CLIENT_URL` environment variable
   - Your backend will restart automatically

## Option 2: Alternative Free Hosting

### Backend alternatives:

- **Render.com** (Free tier)
- **Fly.io** (Free tier)

### Frontend alternatives:

- **Netlify** (Free tier)
- **GitHub Pages**

## Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Push to GitHub (if not already done)

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Live Meetings App"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/live-meetings-app.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy Backend to Railway

1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign up
2. Click "Start a New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select your repository
4. Set the root directory to `server`
5. Add environment variables:
   - `JWT_SECRET`: `your-super-secret-jwt-key`
   - `CLIENT_URL`: (leave empty for now, will update after frontend deployment)
6. Deploy and note the URL (e.g., `https://web-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`)

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend to Vercel

1. Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up
2. Click "New Project" â†’ Import from GitHub
3. Select your repository
4. Add environment variable:
   - `VITE_API_URL`: `https://your-railway-backend-url`
5. Deploy and note the URL (e.g., `https://live-meetings-app-xxxx.vercel.app`)

### Step 4: Update Backend CORS

1. Go back to Railway dashboard
2. Update the `CLIENT_URL` environment variable with your Vercel URL
3. The backend will restart automatically

## Testing Your Deployment

1. **Open your deployed frontend URL**
2. **Host a meeting:**
   - Click "Host a Meeting"
   - Enter your name
   - Note the meeting ID
3. **Join from another device/browser:**
   - Open the same URL
   - Enter the meeting ID
   - Enter a different name
   - Test the video call!

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **CORS Errors**: Make sure `CLIENT_URL` in Railway matches your Vercel URL exactly
2. **Socket.IO Connection Failed**: Check that `VITE_API_URL` points to your Railway backend
3. **Video/Audio Not Working**: Ensure you're using HTTPS (both services provide this)

### Checking Logs:

- **Railway**: Go to your project â†’ "Deployments" â†’ Click on latest deployment â†’ "View Logs"
- **Vercel**: Go to your project â†’ "Functions" tab to see any errors

## URLs to Share

Once deployed, you'll have:

- **Frontend**: `https://your-app.vercel.app` (share this with friends)
- **Backend**: `https://your-app.railway.app` (used internally)

## Free Tier Limitations

- **Railway**: 500 hours/month, $5 credit
- **Vercel**: 100GB bandwidth, unlimited static deployments

Perfect for testing and demos!

## Next Steps

1. Test thoroughly with friends
2. Consider custom domain (both services support this)
3. Add analytics if needed
4. Monitor usage to stay within free tiers

Happy testing! ðŸŽ‰
